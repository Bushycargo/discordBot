# discordBot
Discord bot written in Java

Cheeky little discord bot written in Java using JDA.

I am expanding on it, but feel free to download a copy and expand it yourself.
Adding new commands is quite simple, just write the new command in the commands package like the other commands then add the command into Commands.java

# Installation
I highly suggest creating a script to auto-update the bot and run it, while keeping a settings file seperate to conserve settings, this is how I have done it: https://pastebin.com/7D8yHd1f and then I have a copy of the settings.json in the same place as my run script and the bot will be one directory below.
